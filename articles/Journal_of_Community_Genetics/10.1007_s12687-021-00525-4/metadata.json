  "abstract": "\u003cjats:title\u003eAbstract\u003c/jats:title\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eAddressing the many challenges posed by rare diseases to patients, families, and society at large demands a specific national (as well as transnational) focus. Historically, the practice of elaborating and adopting national plans and strategies for rare diseases, following a request from the European Commission in 2009, has been an essential means of ensuring this focus, with 25 European Member States having adopted a plan or strategy at some stage. However, from the vantage point of late 2020, there are signs that momentum and commitment to the development, implementation, and renewal of national plans is waning, in some cases. In this article, we examine the status quo and explore the trend for national plans and strategies to expire without clear commitments or timelines for replacement. We also examine the factors and institutions which supported the initial drive towards the adoption of national plans and strategies in Europe and consider the very different climate in which the next generation of national policies may—or may not—be shaped.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
