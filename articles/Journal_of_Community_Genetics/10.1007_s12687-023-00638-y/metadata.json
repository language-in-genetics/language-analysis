Hannah Wand is co-chair of the NIH ClinGen Consortium’s Complex Disease working group, lead author of the National Society of Genetic Counselors practice resource on polygenic scores, and a committee member for the American College of Medical Genetics practice resource and laboratory Q\u0026A on polygenic scores. Daphen Martschenko is a guest editor for this special edition, and a member of the Hastings Center working group for social and behavioral genomics, which looks at the ethical responsibility of polygenic scores. Ting Pun has served on the advisory panel for patient engagement for the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute as a patient member."

Participants are considered working group members in working groups with Stanford faculty, rather than serving as research participants. The Patient and Family Partner Program managers were extensively consulted about appropriate permission processes for publication. At the introductory call, during the contracting process, all participants expressed an interest in disseminating this information to the external scientific community (see Supplementary Note InternalRef removed). Verbal consent was obtained to record and transcribe meetings, and written permission was obtained by email to write and publish this manuscript. In the email requesting permission, community members were informed on the goal of manuscript writing and a general outline of content to help them decide if this manuscript was an appropriate publication on behalf of the group. Four community members volunteered to meet regularly and engage in the manuscript writing process as authors. All community members were sent draft and final versions of the manuscript for approval. Community members were asked to include a motivation statement and their name in acknowledgments at their volition; only one member opted out and is acknowledged as an anonymous member."
