  "abstract": "\u003cjats:title\u003eAbstract\u003c/jats:title\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eIt is believed that \u0026gt;95% of people with Lynch syndrome (LS) remain undiagnosed. Within the National Health Service (NHS) in England, formal guidelines issued in 2017 state that all colorectal cancers (CRC) should be tested for DNA Mismatch Repair deficiency (dMMR). We used a comprehensive population-level national dataset to analyse implementation of the agreed diagnostic pathway at a baseline point 2 years post-publication of official guidelines. Using real-world data collected and curated by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), we retrospectively followed up all people diagnosed with CRC in England in 2019. Nationwide laboratory diagnostic data incorporated somatic (tumour) testing for dMMR (via immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability), somatic testing for \u003cjats:italic\u003eMLH1\u003c/jats:italic\u003e promoter methylation and \u003cjats:italic\u003eBRAF\u003c/jats:italic\u003e status, and constitutional (germline) testing of MMR genes. Only 44% of CRCs were screened for dMMR; these figures varied over four-fold with respect to geography. Of those CRCs identified as dMMR, only 51% underwent subsequent diagnostic testing. Overall, only 1.3% of patients with colorectal cancer had a germline MMR genetic test performed; up to 37% of these tests occurred outside of NICE guidelines. The low rates of molecular diagnostic testing in CRC support the premise that Lynch syndrome is underdiagnosed, with significant attrition at all stages of the testing pathway. Applying our methodology to subsequent years’ data will allow ongoing monitoring and analysis of the impact of recent investment. If the diagnostic guidelines were fully implemented, we estimate that up to 700 additional people with LS could be identified each year.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
