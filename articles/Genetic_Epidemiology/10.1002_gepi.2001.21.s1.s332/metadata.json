  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eThe Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 12 simulated data involves a common disease defined by imposing a threshold on a quantitative liability distribution. Associated with the disease are five quantitative risk factors, a quantitative environmental exposure, and a dichotomous environmental variable. Age at disease onset and household membership were also simulated. Genotype data, including 2,855 microsatellites on 22 autosomes, were simulated for 1,497 individuals in 23 families. Phenotype data and sequence data for seven candidate genes were provided for 1,000 of these indiviudals who were “living” and available for study. Data were simulated for 50 replicate samples in each of two populations, a general population and a population isolate formed from a small group of founders. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
