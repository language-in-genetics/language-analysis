Statistical models that incorporate parent‐of‐origin effects (POEs) can improve the power of detecting disease‐associated genes and help explain the missing heritability of diseases. In many studies, children have been sequenced for genome‐wide association testing. But it may become unaffordable to sequence their parents and evaluate POEs. Motivated by the reality, we proposed a budget‐friendly study design of sequencing children and only genotyping their parents through single nucleotide polymorphism array. We developed a powerful likelihood‐based method, which takes into account both sequence reads and linkage disequilibrium to infer the parental origins of children's alleles and estimate their POEs on the outcome. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method and compared it with an existing method using only genotypes, through extensive simulations. Our method showed higher power than the genotype‐based method. When either the mean read depth or the pair‐end length was reasonably large, our method achieved ideal power. When single parents’ genotypes were unavailable or parental genotypes at the testing locus were not typed, both methods lost power compared with when complete data were available; but the power loss from our method was smaller than the genotype‐based method. We also extended our method to accommodate mixed genotype, low‐, and high‐coverage sequence data from children and their parents. At presence of sequence errors, low‐coverage parental sequence data may lead to lower power than parental genotype data.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
