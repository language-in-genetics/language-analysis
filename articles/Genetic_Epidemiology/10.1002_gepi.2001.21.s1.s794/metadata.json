  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eAn extension of the traditional regression of offspring on midparent (ROMP) method was used to estimate the heritability of the trait, test for marker association, and estimate the heritability attributable to a marker locus. The fifty replicates of the Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 12 simulated general population data were used to compare the ROMP method with the variance components method as implemented in SOLAR as a test for marker association, and to a standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. Large sample statistical properties of the ROMP and ANOVA methods were compared using 2,000 replicates resampled from the families of the original 50 replicates. Overall, the power to detect a completely associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker was high, and the type I error rates were similar to nominal significance levels for all three methods. The standard deviations of the estimates of the heritability of the trait were large for both SOLAR and ROMP, but the estimates were, on average, close to those of the generating model for both methods. However, on average, SOLAR overestimated the heritability attributable to the associated SNP marker (by 256%) while ROMP underestimated it (by 26%). © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
