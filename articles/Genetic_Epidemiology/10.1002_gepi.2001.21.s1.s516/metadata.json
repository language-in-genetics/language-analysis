  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eThe purpose of this study was to propose and evaluate a novel multivariate approach for genetic mapping of complex binary human diseases. This approach uses the application of either of two methods of standard (stepwise) discriminant analysis to detect linkage based on the differential marker identity‐by‐descent distributions among the three affection groups of sib pairs (concordantly affected, discordant, and concordantly unaffected). One of the advantages of this approach is that it allows for simultaneously testing all markers, as well as other genetic and environmental factors, in a single multivariate setting. We have explored its properties and behaviors via an application to the simulated data in Genetic Analysis Workshop 12. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
