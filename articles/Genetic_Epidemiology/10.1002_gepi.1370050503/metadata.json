  "abstract": "\u003cjats:title\u003eAbstract\u003c/jats:title\u003e\u003cjats:p\u003eIn examining genetic influences on biological variables using twins, it may be important to examine the distribution between and within twin pairs of demographic and lifestyle factors that may themselves affect the biological variable being studied. We explored the distribution of demographic and lifestyle factors that may affect blood lipid levels or ischaemic heart disease (IHD) risk among a sample of 106 monozygotic (MZ) and 94 like‐sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. In our sample, MZ twins were statistically significantly different from DZ twins only in marital status, cigarette smoking habits, and the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat (P:S ratio) in their dietary intake. The latter variable was among many dietary variables examined (using 4‐day weighed food diaries), and the size of the difference in intake was small. When comparisons were made of the similarities within twin pairs, we found members of MZ twin pairs to be statistically significantly closer than DZ twins in educational achievement, occupation, cigarette smoking, and exercise habits, and the number of days a week on which alcohol was consumed. These last three variables were consistently closer among twins with closer contact than among those with a smaller degree of current shared environment. For 12 of the 13 nutrients examined, the within‐pair correlations were higher for MZ than for DZ twins, although our test for significant genetic variance showed statistical significance only for intake of complex carbohydrates. We conclude that MZ twins share demographic and lifestyle factors that might influence the risk of IHD and blood lipid levels to a greater degree than do DZ twins, although it is difficult to say if these similarities in lifestyle result from genetic influences or not. Nevertheless, ascribing differences between correlations in MZ and DZ twin pairs for lipid levels as being purely “genetic”–as implicit in conventional measures of heritability–is likely to overestimate the influence of genetic factors.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
