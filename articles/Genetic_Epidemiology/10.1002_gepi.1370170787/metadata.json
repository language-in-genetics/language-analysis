Hence, we investigate the effects of two environmental factors. We selected 400 nuclear families from the data generated for Problem 2. Affection status was investigated in several ways. Individuals with severe and mild forms of the disease were both considered affected, individuals with only the severe form were considered affected while those with the mild form were considered unknown, and individuals with only the mild form were considered affected while those with the severe form were considered unknown. We found evidence of linkage between putative disease loci and markers in the D3G042‐D3G049 and D5G031‐D5G042 regions when we considered severely and mildly affected individuals as affected and also in the region D1G004‐D1G013 when mildly affected individuals were considered unknown. We observed interactions between the first environmental factor and D1G043 among healthy sib pairs.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
