Genetic and environmental components of covariation were modeled by time series. For both measures, shared environmental influences were absent and specific environmental influences were largely time‐specific. Although heritability was about 0.5 at each time point, genetic variation present at middle age contributed only about 60% to that present 9 years later, the remaining 40% being new. Fifteen years later, at the third time point, no new genetic variation was evident, variation in individual differences being entirely attributable to genetic differences laid down at the two earlier ages. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
