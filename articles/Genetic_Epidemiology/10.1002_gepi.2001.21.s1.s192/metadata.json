  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eThe purpose of our study was to detect genetic heterogeneity (i.e., different genotype relative risks of genetic factor) between atopic and non‐atopic asthma and between atopy associated or independent of asthma. Genetic heterogeneity was tested in the Caucasian Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Asthma families using the TTS (triangle test statistic) and the predivided sample test. The ITS was proposed to detect both linkage and intra‐sib‐pair genetic heterogeneity; such heterogeneity may exist if the sibs differ for a factor on which the penetrances of the putative linked gene depend. The TTS has been applied to asthmatic pairs discordant for atopy and atopic sib pairs discordant for asthma. To confirm genetic heterogeneity detected by the ITS, the predivided sample test was also applied among concordant and discordant sib pairs. The analyses detected a genetic factor on chromosome 8p that could be involved in atopy with different genotype relative risks according to whether asthma is present. This would suggest a pleiotropic effect of this genetic factor in asthma and atopy. Two other regions located on chromosomes 8q and 20p were detected for genetic heterogeneity with asthma and atopy, respectively, but the factor of heterogeneity could be independent from the presence of atopy or asthma, respectively. It could be a characteristic of the disease such as the severity or the presence of an environmental factor. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
