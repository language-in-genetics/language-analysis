  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eWe analyzed a quantitative trait (serum IgE levels), and a binary trait (asthma), in four Hutterite sub‐pedigrees. A genome screen for asthma was performed using GENEHUNTER, and interesting regions were followed up using extended pedigrees and the FASTLINK package. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to assess haplotype sharing among affected individuals (MORGAN/AUTOZYG), and to perform a combined oligogenic segregation and linkage analysis (LOKI) for log\u003cjats:sub\u003e10\u003c/jats:sub\u003e(IgE). We found evidence for at least two susceptibility loci for asthma on chromosome 5, and a QTL for log\u003cjats:sub\u003e10\u003c/jats:sub\u003e(IgE) on chromosome 1. Our analyses demonstrate that using the most complete pedigree structure possible is advisable, with attention to the possibility of heterogeneity among subunits of a very large pedigree. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
