  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eClassical parametric two‐point linkage analysis is a powerful analysis tool, however there are clear disadvantages too, including the sensitivity to allele frequency misspecification. Conversely, multipoint linkage analysis is not sensitive to allele frequency misspecification, but it is sensitive to genetic model misspecification. Göring and Terwilliger [Am J Hum Genet 66:1095–106, 2000] proposed a new robust multipoint statistic that increased the robustness of multipoint analyses. In this paper we have referred to this new statistic as the tlod. We applied this new statistic to the Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 12 data using affected status (AFF) as the phenotype of interest. The heterogeneity tlod and two‐point hlod scores correlated highly across the genome (p \u0026lt; 0.0001), as expected, but the het‐tlod had a lower number false positives. In addition, the tlod analysis handled missing data better, as would be expected for a multipoint method. When one‐third of the genotype data was removed (dead people) the tlod analysis was less affected than the two‐point analysis. When tlod scores were compared with multipoint lod scores in true gene locations, the robustness of the tlod to model misspecification was clearly evident. When the “best” replicate from the general population was analyzed, a borderline genome‐wide significant two‐point hlod result (3.6) was found 4 cM from MG6 and MG7 on chromosome 6. The heterogeneity tlod score was lower than the two‐point hlod score (1.8), but greater than the heterogeneity multipoint lod score (0.4). However, when replicate 1 of the isolated population was analyzed none of the true gene locations were identified with either statistic. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
