  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eWe explored methods for kinship and linkage analysis in a Hutterite pedigree comprising 1,544 individuals, 72 of whom were diagnosed with asthma. Subpedigrees were selected by (a) identifying nuclear families containing asthmatics, (b) identifying couples with many asthmatic descendants in an \u003cjats:italic\u003ead hoc\u003c/jats:italic\u003e manner, and (c) finding the most recent common ancestors of all asthmatics. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to estimate allele sharing in the larger subpedigrees and transmission/disequilibrium tests were performed on nuclear families. On chromosome 5q near the cytokine cluster, modest evidence for linkage to asthma was obtained. Using MCMC, we were able to evaluate the evidence for linkage in complex subpedigrees of several hundred individuals, and hence, incorporate some of the co‐ancestry of this founder population. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
