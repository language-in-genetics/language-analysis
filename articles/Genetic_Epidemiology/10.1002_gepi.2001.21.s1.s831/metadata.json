  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eWe address the question of whether one can obtain increased power for finding a quantitative trait locus (QTL) if a gene×environment (G×E) interaction is incorporated directly into the linkage analysis. We consider both parametric and nonparametric analysis approaches to including G×E interaction. For the former, we utilize joint segregation and linkage analysis to estimate simultaneously the recombination fraction and a G×E interaction effect, as well as the remaining model parameters. The nonparametric approach is based on an extension of the Haseman‐Elston method applied to sib pairs to include a regression of the squared trait difference on marker‐identity‐by‐descent (IBD) probability (π), the sibling covariate sum (z), and π×z. We utilize 50 replicates of the simulated data and compare empirical power of the various approaches to detect MG4, a locus that is involved in a strong interaction with age for Q4 and in a weaker interaction with environmental factor E2 for Q3. Using the parametric approach, including a G×age effect does increase power for detecting linkage between MG4 and Q4 compared with ignoring the interaction (powers 58% and 38%, respectively, to exceed a lod score of 3.0). On the other hand, including a G×E2 interaction has little effect on the power to detect linkage between MG4 and Q3. The nonparametric approach leads to qualitatively similar findings. We conclude that it is beneficial to incorporate G×E interaction into a linkage analysis, provided the interaction effect is of sufficiently strong magnitude. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
