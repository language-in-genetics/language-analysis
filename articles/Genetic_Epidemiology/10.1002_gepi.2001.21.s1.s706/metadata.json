  "abstract": "\u003cjats:p\u003eWe explore an approach that allows us to consider a trait for which we wish to determine the optimal subset of markers out of a set of \u003cjats:italic\u003ep\u003c/jats:italic\u003e ≥ 3 candidate markers being considered in a linkage analysis. The most effective analysis would find the model that only includes the \u003cjats:italic\u003eq\u003c/jats:italic\u003e markers closest to the \u003cjats:italic\u003eq\u003c/jats:italic\u003e major genes which determine the trait. Finding this optimal model using classical “frequentist” multiple regression techniques would require consideration of all 2\u003cjats:italic\u003e\u003cjats:sup\u003ep\u003c/jats:sup\u003e\u003c/jats:italic\u003e possible subsets. We apply the work of George and McCulloch [J Am Stat Assoc 88:881–9, 1993], who have developed a Bayesian approach to optimal subset selection regression, to a modification of the Baseman ‐ Elston linkage statistic [Elston et al., Genet Epidemiol 19:1–17, 2000] in the analysis of the two quantitative traits simulated in Problem 2. The results obtained using this Bayesian method are compared to those obtained using (1) multiple regression and (2) the modified Haseman‐Elston method (single variable regression analysis). We note upon doing this that for both Q1 and Q2, (1) we have extremely low power with all methods using the samples as given and have to resort to combining several simulated samples in order to have power of 50%, (2) the multivariate analysis does not have greater power than the univariate analysis for these traits, and (3) the Bayesian approach identifies the correct model more frequently than the frequentist approaches but shows no clear advantage over the multivariate approach. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\u003c/jats:p\u003e",
